Hi, I’m Rajdeep Chakraborty! I am currently working as a Research Assistant at the Indian Institute of Science. My academic journey began in Mechanical engineering, but thanks to a pandemic-fueled binge of brain documentaries and books, I found myself increasingly fascinated by the complexities of the brain.

The fascination slowly turned into a determined journey to carve a path into Neuroscience. Since then, I’ve been working to bridge my Engineering background with a deep interest in understanding how the brain works. Along the way, I’ve worked as an online Math tutor and as a Technical Editor for a publishing house.

I’m especially excited about building tools that can translate cutting-edge research into real-world healthcare applications. My focus lies in developing quantitative models and computational methods, particularly using Machine Learning, to improve our understanding of psychiatric conditions and design better mental health interventions.

Apart from that, I enjoy watching Formula 1, reading up on obscure historical facts, diving into philosophical rabbit holes, and learning Mathematics just for the joy of it.
