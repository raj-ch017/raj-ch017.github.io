        - title: Project 1 - Role of Superior Colliculus in Head Orientation towards Noxious Stimulus<br><br>
          contents:
          
            - Utilised transgenic mice and chemogenetic techniques to investigate the role of the Superior Colliculus (SC) in mediating head orientation towards noxious stimuli.
            - Performed stereotaxic injections of Adeno-Associated Viruses (AAVs) to target and manipulate specific neuronal populations within the SC.
            - Used viral tracers to decode the underlying neural circuit.
